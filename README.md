# Explainable-AI-for-Sentiment-Analysis-on-Movie-Review
This project focuses on sentiment classification using ensemble machine learning models, enhanced with explainable AI (XAI) techniques like LIME and SHAP.

📂 Contents

* ensemble-Final.ipynb: Implements various models (LSTM, GRU, BERT, etc.) and combines them using a stacking ensemble to improve accuracy.

* XAI-Final.ipynb: Applies LIME and SHAP for model interpretability and explanation.

⚙️ Tech Stack


Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn
Hugging Face Transformers
SHAP, LIME
Jupyter Notebook

🚀 Goal

Improve classification accuracy using ensemble methods and provide insights into model decisions using XAI tools.
